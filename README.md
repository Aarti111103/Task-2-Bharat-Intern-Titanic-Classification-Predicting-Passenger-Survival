# Titanic Classification: Predicting Passenger Survival
## ðŸŒŠ Introduction
Welcome to the Titanic Classification project! The tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic has become one of the most famous maritime disasters in history. But it also provides a fascinating dataset for data scientists. In this project, weâ€™ll build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic, using various data science techniques in Python.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. This project serves as an excellent introduction to data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the well-known "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset available on Kaggle. It includes information on passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries
We'll be leveraging the following tools and libraries:

Python: The programming language for our analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: To create visualizations that help in understanding the data.

Scikit-learn: To build and evaluate our machine learning models.

## ðŸš€ Methodology
Data Exploration: We start by exploring the dataset to understand the features and identify any missing values.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features and refining existing ones to improve model performance.

Model Building: Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict survival.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of our models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
